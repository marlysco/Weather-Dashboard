# Weather-Dashboard

The goal of this project was to create an app, that using third-party APIs, shows the weather dashboard, of any city.

This weather dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

The recently seached cities will be shown in a left bar, to quick search
